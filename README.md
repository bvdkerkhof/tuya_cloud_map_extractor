# Tuya cloud vaccum map extractor
This integration extracts and exposes live maps from tuya laser vaccums into Home Assistant.

## Disclaimer
This is my first Home Assistant integration, so if things go terribly wrong, please create an issue so i can learn from and fix it.

## Installation


### Using HACS
This integration is not yet in HACS default repository, but can be manually installed via HACS.
Add this repository as a custom repository in HACS, and install as normal.


### Manually 
To install this integration, manually add the contents of custom_components to your home assistant custom_components folder, and reboot.

## Configuration


### Prerequisites
* A vacuum with Lidar support already added to the Tuya/Smart app.
* A configured Tuya IoT development platform, including the following components:
    - A cloud project and linked device. (Need help? See the [Tuya integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/tuya/#configuration-of-the-tuya-iot-platform).)
    - The Tuya Sweeping Robot Open API added to the cloud platform (Main Menu -> Cloud -> Development - Service API and make sure to have Sweeping Robot Open Service added to the list of authorized services or the integration will not install and will return an "unknown" error).

### Configuration in Home Assistant
After the installation of this integration into Home Assistant, the integration is configured via config flow. Add a new integration via the UI and choose "Tuya Vacuum Map Extractor". Then enter your Tuya IoT platform credentials.

### Turn on and turn off
By default, the vacuum map camera is turned off. You have to manually call the service camera.turn_on and camera.turn_off. I would recommend [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PiotrMachowski/Home-Assistant-custom-components-Xiaomi-Cloud-Map-Extractor/master/blueprints/automation/disable_vacuum_camera_update_when_docked.yaml) blueprint to automatically turn on and off camera updates depending on if the vacuum is docked or not.
